<h1>History of Barebow<h1>
<p>Barebow archery has its roots in the earliest forms of archery, when humans first crafted simple wooden bows for hunting and warfare. For thousands of years, archers relied solely on their skill and instinct, without any modern aiming devices or stabilizersâ€”making all early archery, by definition, barebow. As archery evolved into a sport in the 20th century, technological advancements introduced sights, stabilizers, and other aids, leading to a divide between traditional and modern styles. Barebow emerged as a distinct discipline during this time, especially within field and 3D archery competitions. The term "barebow" gained recognition in organizations like the National Field Archery Association (NFAA) and later the World Archery Federation, which officially included barebow categories in target and indoor competitions. Today, barebow archery blends ancient techniques with modern equipment, attracting archers who value precision, instinct, and simplicity over technology.</p>
